## About the dataset
The stereo wav files were synthesized by GarageBand v10.3.2 on macOS Mojave v10.14.4. The samplerate is 44100 kHz and the quality setting is "Uncompressed 16-bit (CD Quality)" . Wav files were manually synthesized so the format of the content may vary; different clip length and starting time of each note. I played notes on keyboards so the recordings should have equal velocity and similar envelop. However, I did not verify the statement.
